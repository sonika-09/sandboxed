  <h2 class="volume-title"><strong>When Cities Go Dark: The St. Paul Cyber Breach</strong></h2>
  </header>

      <h3>A single RAT opened the gates — unleashing 43GB of stolen files and weeks of digital chaos.</h3>
      <p>
        On July 25th, 2025, the cybersecurity systems of St. Paul warned the city about a cyberattack 
        disguised as a glitch. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately, professionals saw the shadow of a massive threat and pulled the lever on the city’s 
        digital engine. The entirety of Minnesota whispered and tiptoed in darkness for weeks, while cyber 
        analysts tried to contain the attack. And on August 10th, it was confirmed that this was a ransomware 
        attack conducted by the Interlock ransomware group. It was found that they had access to a trove of 
        43GB, spanning nearly 66,000 files from Parks & Recreation drives, which included everything from work 
        documents and IDs to personal items.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, according to threat intelligence, the attackers gained access to St. Paul’s systems using 
        a custom SystemBC RAT (Remote Access Trojan) — which is a malware that creates SOCKS5 network tunnels 
        in the victim’s network and connects to its C2 server using RC4-encrypted protocol. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, this suspicious behavior was detected by the city’s security systems — possibly via its 
        Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems, which serve as real-time defenses on individual devices. 
        To prevent the escalation of the attack, officials decided to implement a full shutdown of internal 
        networks, public Wi-Fi, and online payment portals. Upon being asked for ransom, the officials refused 
        and continued to attempt to suppress the damage, which resulted in a leak of 43GB of data on Interlock’s 
        website, exposing thousands of sensitive records.
      </p>
      <p>
        Officials said there was no evidence of widespread exposure of residents’ Social Security numbers; the 
        leaked data largely came from a Parks & Recreation shared drive and included work documents, IDs, and 
        some personal items. Now, St. Paul is in recovery—patching systems, resetting passwords, and building 
        digital walls higher than ever before.
      </p>

      <h3>Bill payments halted, trust shattered, and millions lost — the hidden cost of saying no to ransom.</h3>
      <p>
        As a repercussion to resisting ransom payments, St. Paul lost 43GB of employee and government data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Citizen transactions froze, city revenue disrupted, and public trust crumbled— all due to service delays. 
        Public disappointment and distrust uproar was fueled by frustration as systems went down; an inconvenience 
        to paying bills and approvals of permits or licences. WiFi disconnections became common and everyday 
        administrative tasks stalled, leaving both residents and businesses at a standstill. What should have been 
        routine interactions with the city suddenly turned into obstacles, amplifying the perception that St. Paul 
        was digitally unprepared for a crisis of this scale. An estimated tens of millions of dollars plunged in 
        recovery expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The breach didn’t just affect residents — it also disheveled St. Paul’s own workforce. Over 3,500 employees 
        were forced to reset accounts in a rushed emergency setup, curating stress and staggering morale. The leak 
        of internal emails and records hampered staff confidence in the city’s ability to protect sensitive 
        information. Similarly, the exposure raises regulatory and policy risks: pressure collating for tighter state 
        and federal oversight of municipal cybersecurity, while potential lawsuits from employees loom if leaked data 
        leads to harm. The crisis also raises the question — should cities be required to carry cyber liability 
        insurance, just as corporations do, to safeguard against the financial shocks of future attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
        Cyberattacks on cities don’t just disrupt government—they generate the negative ripple effect into the wider 
        economy. When permits, licenses, and payments are stalled, local business activity slows, creating structural 
        problems. Protecting city systems is now just as important for the economy as keeping banks running. In the long 
        run, this will likely push governments to spend more on strengthening municipal cyber defenses.
