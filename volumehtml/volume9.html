      <h3>Stuxnet: A Cyberattack with Physical Consequences</h3>
      <p>
        “New light through old Windows”, said Malwarebytes’ Senior Director of Threat Intelligence Jérôme Segura in 2010, when 
        the world witnessed a cyberattack that was capable of causing physical destruction through malware. Stuxnet, a worm 
        designed to sabotage industrial control systems, was deployed at Iran’s Natanz nuclear enrichment facility. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This type of malicious software was specifically targeted at the Siemens PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), which were 
        controlling centrifuges that were being used for uranium enrichment. Stuxnet was furtively introduced via infected USB drives 
        into air-gapped networks, which is ironic since these networks are meant to isolate from all external networks, hence providing 
        high security. Next, unlike a virus, this malware did not require human interaction to activate and began exploiting multiple 
        Windows zero-day vulnerabilities, allowing RCE, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the worm manipulated the rotation speeds of the centrifuges, causing mechanical stress, hence slowing down uranium 
        enrichment. The monitoring systems were made to show false sensor data to mask the malicious actions taking place, which is why 
        it took a while for the malware to be detected. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, Stuxnet wriggled its way from device to device, infecting multiple systems and spreading across different countries, making 
        its impact global. But upon detection, Microsoft rapidly issued patches for the zero-day vulnerabilities, new malware detection rules 
        were made, and the infected Windows machines were cleaned or reimaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key takeaway is that malware can be utilized for something far worse than stealing data, and isolation without controls is a false 
        sense of security. Security must be a core design requirement, not an afterthought.
