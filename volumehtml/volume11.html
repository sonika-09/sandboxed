      <h3>Colonial Pipeline: When Ransomware Hit Critical Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        In May 2021, the world saw how a cyberattack on a single company could disrupt everyday life. The target was 
        Colonial Pipeline, one of the largest fuel pipeline operators in the United States, responsible for transporting 
        nearly 45% of the fuel consumed along the East Coast. What began as a ransomware incident quickly escalated into 
        a national supply crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The attack was carried out by a cybercriminal group known as DarkSide, which operated under a ransomware-as-a-service 
        model. Instead of directly attacking every victim themselves, the group developed the ransomware and allowed affiliates 
        to deploy it in exchange for a share of the ransom payments. The attackers gained access through a compromised VPN 
        account that reportedly lacked multi-factor authentication, demonstrating how a single weak entry point can expose an 
        entire enterprise network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once inside, the attackers deployed ransomware that encrypted parts of Colonial Pipeline’s business systems. Although the 
        operational technology controlling the actual pipeline was not directly infected, the company proactively shut down 
        pipeline operations to prevent the malware from spreading further. This decision caused temporary fuel shortages, panic 
        buying, and price spikes across several regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        To regain control quickly, Colonial Pipeline paid approximately $4.4 million in cryptocurrency to obtain a decryption tool. 
        However, the recovery process was slower than expected, as the tool itself was inefficient. Shortly afterward, the Federal 
        Bureau of Investigation tracked the cryptocurrency transactions and successfully recovered a portion of the ransom, 
        highlighting the growing capability of law enforcement in tracing digital payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Colonial Pipeline incident underscored a major shift in cybersecurity reality: attacks are no longer limited to data 
        theft—they can disrupt real-world infrastructure and daily life. The key takeaway is that cybersecurity gaps in business 
        networks can indirectly impact operational systems, and basic protections like multi-factor authentication and network 
        segmentation are essential safeguards, not optional upgrades.

      <h3>A Pipeline Crisis, A Governance Lesson</h3>
      <p>
        “Paying the ransom to DarkSide hackers was the hardest decision I’ve made in my 39 years in the energy industry.” 
        — Joseph Blount Jr. (CEO, Colonial Pipeline)
      </p>
      <p>
        In May 2021, Colonial Pipeline, operator of the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, was forced to shut down operations 
        after a ransomware attack by DarkSide. What began as a compromised VPN password quickly escalated into a nationwide supply shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        As news of the shutdown spread, panic buying surged across the U.S. East Coast. Gas stations ran dry. Fuel prices climbed. Airlines and 
        logistics firms scrambled to reroute supply chains. The federal government declared a regional emergency to stabilize distribution. A 
        private cybersecurity lapse had transformed into a public economic disruption.

      </p>
      <p>
        The company ultimately paid $4.4 million in Bitcoin to regain access— a decision that sparked fierce debate. While operations resumed, the 
        reputational cost lingered. Questions surfaced about executive oversight, weak authentication protocols, and whether paying ransoms fuels 
        a growing cybercrime economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The attack reframed cybersecurity from a backend IT function to a boardroom-level risk. For energy firms, regulators, and investors, it was a 
        wake-up call: operational resilience is no longer just about physical infrastructure, but about digital defense.
