      <h3>Buffer Overrun, System Undone: The Technical Anatomy of Boeing’s Cyber Breach</h3>
      <p>
        In October 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment linked to the LockBit ransomware group,
        revealing charges against individuals who had infiltrated the reputable aeronautical company Boeing.
        LockBit claimed a ransom demand of $200 million to decrypt sensitive company data and prevent the release
        of the organization's private information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The attackers are believed to have exploited vulnerabilities in Boeing’s Citrix infrastructure—specifically
        CVE-2023-4966, also known as Citrix Bleed. This buffer-related flaw was found in several of Citrix’s products,
        including NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway. The vulnerability functioned like a broken door hinge—
        allowing attackers to slip past authentication mechanisms and into restricted systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Boeing has not publicly shared exact details of the breach, here’s one plausible scenario.
        An attacker could have triggered an HTTP GET request to an OpenID Connect endpoint (an authentication protocol),
        supplying an overly long Host header. This may have caused a memory over-read, leaking session cookies,
        credentials, and internal state data.
      </p>
      <p>
        These credentials let attackers impersonate users or admins without passwords.
        Since Citrix Gateway is often used for VPN access, hijacked sessions could enable lateral movement into Boeing's
        internal systems — accessing emails, databases, and applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        LockBit claimed responsibility and reportedly exfiltrated 43GB of data, leaking it after Boeing allegedly refused
        to pay. Citrix later released security patches, and agencies like CISA and NIST issued public advisories.

      <h3>Beyond the Breach: Boeing’s Cyber Attack and the Collapse of Confidence</h3>
      <p>
        “I believe this may be the second biggest ransom demand to date — or, perhaps more accurately,
        to have become public knowledge,” said Brett Callow, a ransomware analyst with the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Boeing did not pay the $200 million, the fallout was enormous. One major casualty: trust.
        Over 107 years of reputation took a hit as the breach exposed vulnerabilities in Boeing’s supply chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Investor confidence wavered. Partners reassessed risk. Regulatory scrutiny deepened. And defense clients began
        reconsidering their reliance on a newly "digitally vulnerable" supplier. Boeing’s stock dipped, and resources
        were rapidly redirected to cybersecurity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crisis response costs skyrocketed. While Boeing likely had cyber insurance, premium hikes and emergency team
        costs added up. Long-term, the company faces investments in infrastructure, compliance, and digital controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a major defense contractor, Boeing’s cyber weaknesses now raise questions about future contract eligibility.
        The breach didn’t just affect Boeing — it spotlighted cracks in aviation’s digital armor. For Boeing,
        this may not be a one-off, but a warning for what lies ahead.
